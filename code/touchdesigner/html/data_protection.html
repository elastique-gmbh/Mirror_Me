        <p class="ce">– hereafter referred to as 'Elastique.' –</p>
        
        
        <p>As part of the MIRROR ME installation at the Us By Night event in Antwerp from 26.09. to 28.09.2024 ('Event'), Elastique. would like to make video recordings on which I am displayed.</p>
        
        <p>I hereby consent to Elastique. or third parties authorized or commissioned by Elastique. distributing and publishing the videos made of me during the event, as well as reproductions and excerpts thereof, in modified or unmodified form, for the purposes and to the extent specified below, without further restriction.<br/>
        Elastique. guarantees that the material will not be edited to distort the meaning. The videos may be published for an indefinite period in/on the following media (worldwide):</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Social media profiles of companies of Elastique. GmbH (Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin, Xing, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, etc.)</li>
            <li>Websites of companies of Elastique. GmbH</li>
            <li>Online portals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The photos are used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul><li>Press/public relations</li>
            <li>Advertising/marketing measures</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If the video recordings provide information about my ethnic origin, religion or health (e.g. skin color, headgear, glasses), the consent I have given here also relates to this information.</p>
        
        <p>I am aware that information on the Internet is accessible worldwide and can be found using search engines and linked to other information. Information posted on the Internet, including photos, can be easily copied and redistributed. There are specialized archiving services whose aim is to permanently document the status of certain websites on certain dates. This can lead to that information published on the Internet can still be found elsewhere even after it has been deleted from the original site.</p>
       <p>I agree that Elastique. may use the recordings to the extent and for the purposes stated above. I give this consent voluntarily. I can refuse my consent without giving reasons and without fear of any disadvantages. I can also revoke this consent at any time in text form (e.g. letter, email). Photographs that essentially only show me will then be removed immediately from the Elastique. internet channels mentioned above and will no longer be used for new printed matter.</p>
        
       <p>I do not wish my name to be mentioned, but I also agree that my name or another name may be mentioned in connection with the pictures.</p>
